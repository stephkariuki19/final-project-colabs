Work with your doctor to\\ndetermine what to do when your signs and symptoms worsen -- and when you need\\nemergency treatment. Signs of an asthma emergency include:\\n\\n  * Rapid worsening of shortness of breath or wheezing\\n  * No improvement even after using a quick-relief inhaler\\n  * Shortness of breath when you are doing minimal physical activity\\n\\n#### Contact your doctor\\n\\nSee your doctor:\\n\\n  * **If you think you have asthma.** If you have frequent coughing or wheezing that lasts more than a few days or any other signs or symptoms of asthma, see your doctor. Treating asthma early may prevent long-term lung damage and help keep the condition from getting worse over time.\\n  * **To monitor your asthma after diagnosis.** If you know you have asthma, work with your doctor to keep it under control. Good long-term control helps you feel better from day to day and can prevent a life-threatening asthma attack.\\n  * **If your asthma symptoms get worse.** Contact your doctor right away if your medication doesn't seem to ease your symptoms or if you need to use your quick-relief inhaler more often.\\n\\nDon't take more medication than prescribed without consulting your doctor\\nfirst. Overusing asthma medication can cause side effects and may make your\\nasthma worse.\\n\\n  * **To review your treatment.** Asthma often changes over time. Meet with your doctor regularly to discuss your symptoms and make any needed treatment adjustments.\\n\\n\\n\\n##\\n\\n## Causes\\n\\nIt isn't clear why some people get asthma and others don't, but it's probably\\ndue to a combination of environmental and inherited (genetic) factors.\\n\\n### Asthma triggers\\n\\nExposure to various irritants and substances that trigger allergies\\n(allergens) can trigger signs and symptoms of asthma. Asthma triggers are\\ndifferent from person to person and can include:\\n\\n  * Airborne allergens, such as pollen, dust mites, mold spores, pet dander or particles of cockroach waste\\n  * Respiratory infections, such as the common cold\\n  * Physical activity\\n  * Cold air\\n  * Air pollutants and irritants, such as smoke\\n  * Certain medications, including beta blockers, aspirin, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) and naproxen sodium (Aleve)\\n  * Strong emotions and stress\\n  * Sulfites and preservatives added to some types of foods and beverages, including shrimp, dried fruit, processed potatoes, beer and wine\\n  * Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), a condition in which stomach acids back up into your throat\\n\\n### More Information\\n\\n  * Asthma care at Mayo Clinic\\n  * Asthma and acid reflux\\n\\n## \\n---------------------\\nContent for topic 'causes':\\ncauses\\n\\n  * Diagnosis &  \\ntreatment\\n\\n  * Doctors &  \\ndepartments\\n\\n  * Care at  \\nMayo Clinic\\n\\nPrint\\n\\n## Overview\\n\\nAsthma attack Enlarge image\\n\\nClose\\n\\n### Asthma attack\\n\\n### Asthma attack\\n\\nIf you have asthma, the inside walls of the airways in your lungs can become\\ninflamed and swollen. In addition, membranes in your airway linings may\\nsecrete excess mucus. The result is an asthma attack. During an asthma attack,\\nyour narrowed airways make it harder to breathe, and you may cough and wheeze.\\n\\nAsthma is a condition in which your airways narrow and swell and may produce\\nextra mucus. This can make breathing difficult and trigger coughing, a\\nwhistling sound (wheezing) when you breathe out and shortness of breath.\\n\\nFor some people, asthma is a minor nuisance. For others, it can be a major\\nproblem that interferes with daily activities and may lead to a life-\\nthreatening asthma attack.\\n\\nAsthma can't be cured, but its symptoms can be controlled. Because asthma\\noften changes over time, it's important that you work with your doctor to\\ntrack your signs and symptoms and adjust your treatment as needed.\\n\\n### Products & Services\\n\\n  * A Book: Mayo Clinic Book of Home Remedies\\n\\n## Symptoms\\n\\nAsthma symptoms vary from person to person. You may have infrequent asthma\\nattacks, have symptoms only at certain times -- such as when exercising -- or\\nhave symptoms all the time.\\n\\nAsthma signs and symptoms include:\\n\\n  * Shortness of breath\\n  * Chest tightness or pain\\n  * Wheezing when exhaling, which is a common sign of asthma in children\\n  * Trouble sleeping caused by shortness of breath, coughing or wheezing\\n  * Coughing or wheezing attacks that are worsened by a respiratory virus, such as a cold or the flu\\n\\nSigns that your asthma is probably worsening include:\\n\\n  * Asthma signs and symptoms that are more frequent and bothersome\\n  * Increasing difficulty breathing, as measured with a device used to check how well your lungs are working (peak flow meter)\\n  * The need to use a quick-relief inhaler more often\\n\\nFor some people, asthma signs and symptoms flare up in certain situations:\\n\\n  * **Exercise-induced asthma,** which may be worse when the air is cold and dry\\n  * **Occupational asthma,** triggered by workplace irritants such as chemical fumes, gases or dust\\n  * **Allergy-induced asthma,** triggered by airborne substances, such as pollen, mold spores, cockroach waste, or particles of skin and dried saliva shed by pets (pet dander)\\n\\n### \\n---------------------\\nContent for topic 'risk factors':\\nRisk factors\\n\\nA number of factors are thought to increase your chances of developing asthma.\\nThey include:\\n\\n  * Having a blood relative with asthma, such as a parent or sibling\\n  * Having another allergic condition, such as atopic dermatitis -- which causes red, itchy skin -- or hay fever -- which causes a runny nose, congestion and itchy eyes\\n  * Being overweight\\n  * Being a smoker\\n  * Exposure to secondhand smoke\\n  * Exposure to exhaust fumes or other types of pollution\\n  * Exposure to occupational triggers, such as chemicals used in farming, hairdressing and manufacturing\\n\\n## \\n---------------------\\nContent for topic 'complications':\\nComplications\\n\\nAsthma complications include:\\n\\n  * Signs and symptoms that interfere with sleep, work and other activities\\n  * Sick days from work or school during asthma flare-ups\\n  * A permanent narrowing of the tubes that carry air to and from your lungs (bronchial tubes), which affects how well you can breathe\\n  * Emergency room visits and hospitalizations for severe asthma attacks\\n  * Side effects from long-term use of some medications used to stabilize severe asthma\\n\\nProper treatment makes a big difference in preventing both short-term and\\nlong-term complications caused by asthma.\\n\\n## \\n---------------------\\nContent for topic 'prevention':\\nPrevention\\n\\nWhile there's no way to prevent asthma, you and your doctor can design a step-\\nby-step plan for living with your condition and preventing asthma attacks.\\n\\n  * **Follow your asthma action plan.** With your doctor and health care team, write a detailed plan for taking medications and managing an asthma attack. Then be sure to follow your plan.\\n\\nAsthma is an ongoing condition that needs regular monitoring and treatment.\\nTaking control of your treatment can make you feel more in control of your\\nlife.\\n\\n  * **Get vaccinated for influenza and pneumonia.** Staying current with \\n---------------------\\nContent for topic 'vaccination':\\nvaccinations can prevent flu and pneumonia from triggering asthma flare-ups.\\n  * **Identify and avoid asthma triggers.** A number of outdoor allergens and irritants -- ranging from pollen and mold to cold air and air pollution -- can trigger asthma attacks. Find out what causes or worsens your asthma, and take steps to avoid those triggers.\\n  * **Monitor your breathing.** You may learn to recognize warning signs of an impending attack, such as slight coughing, wheezing or shortness of breath.\\n\\nBut because your lung function may decrease before you notice any signs or\\nsymptoms, regularly measure and record your peak airflow with a home peak flow\\nmeter. A peak flow meter measures how hard you can breathe out. Your doctor\\ncan show you how to monitor your peak flow at home.\\n\\n  * **Identify and treat attacks early.** If you act quickly, you're less likely to have a severe attack. You also won't need as much medication to control your symptoms.\\n\\nWhen your peak flow measurements decrease and alert you to an oncoming attack,\\ntake your medication as instructed. Also, immediately stop any activity that\\nmay have triggered the attack. If your symptoms don't improve, get medical\\nhelp as directed in your action plan.\\n\\n  * **Take your medication as prescribed.** Don't change your medications without first talking to your doctor, even if your asthma seems to be improving. It's a good idea to bring your medications with you to each doctor visit. Your doctor can make sure you're using your medications correctly and taking the right dose.\\n  * **Pay attention to increasing quick-relief inhaler use.** If you find yourself relying on your quick-relief inhaler, such as albuterol, your asthma isn't under control. See your doctor about adjusting your treatment.\\n\\n##\", \"\\n\\n  * Symptoms &  \\n\\n\\n\\n##\\n\\n## Causes\\n\\nA blocked airway can cause atelectasis. This is called obstructive\\natelectasis. Pressure from outside the lung also can cause atelectasis. This\\nis called nonobstructive atelectasis.\\n\\nGeneral anesthesia -- which brings on a sleeplike state with the use of\\nmedicines before a procedure or surgery -- is a common cause of atelectasis.\\nIt changes your regular pattern of breathing and affects the exchange of lung\\ngases. This can cause the air sacs in your lungs to lose air. Nearly everyone\\nwho has major surgery has some amount of atelectasis. It often occurs after\\nheart bypass surgery.\\n\\nWhen a blocked airway causes atelectasis, it may be due to:\\n\\n  * **Mucus plug.** A mucus plug is a buildup of sputum or phlegm in your airways. It commonly occurs during and after surgery because you can't cough. Drugs given during surgery make you breathe less deeply. So mucus that usually would move out of your lungs may build up in your airways. Suctioning the lungs during surgery helps clear them. But sometimes mucus still builds up. Mucus plugs also are common in children, people with cystic fibrosis and during severe asthma attacks.\\n  * **Foreign body.** Atelectasis is common in children who have inhaled an object into their lungs, such as a peanut or part of a small toy.\\n  * **Tumor inside the airway.** A growth, which may or may not be cancer, can narrow or block the airway.\\n\\nPossible causes of atelectasis due to pressure from outside the lung include:\\n\\n  * **Injury.** Chest trauma, such as from a fall or car accident, can cause you to avoid taking deep breaths due to pain. This can lead to the squeezing of your lungs.\\n  * **Pleural effusion.** This condition involves the buildup of fluid in the space between the lining of your lungs and the inside of your chest wall.\\n  * **Pneumonia.** Various types of pneumonia, which is a lung infection, can cause atelectasis.\\n  * **Pneumothorax.** This is when air leaks into the space between your lungs and chest wall, causing some or all of a lung to collapse.\\n  * **Scarring of lung tissue.** Injury, lung disease or surgery could cause scarring.\\n  * **Tumor.** A large tumor can press against the lung and force air out of it.\\n\\n## \\n---------------------\\nContent for topic 'causes':\\ncauses\\n\\n  * Diagnosis &  \\ntreatment\\n\\n  * Doctors &  \\ndepartments\\n\\nPrint\\n\\n## Overview\\n\\nAtelectasis (at-uh-LEK-tuh-sis) is the collapse of a lung or part of a lung,\\nalso known as a lobe.

Sometimes the heart gets larger and becomes weak for unknown\\nreasons. This condition is called idiopathic cardiomyopathy.\\n\\nConditions associated with an enlarged heart include:\\n\\n  * **Heart condition present at birth (congenital heart defect).** Problems with the structure and function of the heart can cause the heart muscle to get larger and weak.\\n  * **Damage from a heart attack.** Scarring and other structural heart damage can make it harder for the heart to pump enough blood to the body. The strain can lead to heart swelling and eventual heart failure.\\n  * **Diseases of the heart muscle (cardiomyopathy).** Cardiomyopathy often makes the heart rigid or thick. It can make it harder for the heart to pump blood.\\n  * **Fluid buildup in the sac around the heart (pericardial effusion).** A collection of fluid in the sac that contains the heart can cause heart enlargement that can be seen on a chest X-ray.\\n  * **Heart valve disease.** Four valves in the heart keep blood flowing in the right direction. Disease or damage to any of the valves may interrupt blood flow and cause the heart chambers to get larger.\\n  * **High blood pressure (hypertension).** If you have high blood pressure, the heart may have to pump harder to deliver blood to the rest of the body. The strain can cause the heart muscle to grow larger and become weak.\\n  * **High blood pressure in the arteries in the lungs (pulmonary hypertension).** The heart has to work harder to move blood between the lungs and the heart. The strain may lead to thickening or enlargement of the right side of the heart.\\n  * **Low red blood cell count (anemia).** In anemia, there\\'s a lack of healthy red blood cells to carry proper levels of oxygen to the body\\'s tissues. The heart must pump more blood to make up for the lack of oxygen in the blood.\\n  * **Thyroid disorders.** Both an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism) and an overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism) can lead to heart problems, including an enlarged heart.\\n  * **Too much iron in the body (hemochromatosis).** Iron can build up in various organs, including the heart. This can cause the lower left heart chamber to swell.\\n  * **Unusual protein deposits in the heart (cardiac amyloidosis).** This rare disease causes a protein called amyloid to collect in the blood and get stuck in body organs, including the heart. Amyloid protein deposits in the heart cause an irreversible thickening of the heart wall. The heart has to work harder to fill with blood.\\n  * **Aerobic exercise.** In some athletes, the heart becomes enlarged as a response to frequent and prolonged exercise. Usually, this type of enlarged heart isn\\'t considered a disease and doesn\\'t need treatment.\\n  * **Fat around the heart.** Some people have extra fat around the heart that can appear on a chest X-ray. Unless there are other heart conditions associated, no treatment is necessary.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n## Risk factors\\n\\nThings that can increase the risk of an enlarged heart (cardiomegaly) include:\\n\\n  * **A family history of heart muscle disease (cardiomyopathy).** Some types of cardiomyopathy run in families. Tell your health care provider if a parent or sibling has a history of a thick, rigid or enlarged heart.\\n  * **High blood pressure.** This means having a blood pressure measurement higher than 140/90 millimeters of mercury.\\n  * **Heart diseases.** Any problem affecting the heart, including congenital heart defects or heart valve disease, may lead to heart enlargement. It\\'s important to follow a healthy lifestyle and have regular health checkups to manage heart disease.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n## Complications\\n\\nThe risk of complications from an enlarged heart depends on the part of the\\nheart affected and the cause. Complications of an enlarged heart can include:\\n\\n  * **Heart failure.** Heart failure may occur if the left lower heart chamber (left ventricle) becomes enlarged. In heart failure, the heart can\\'t pump the proper amount of blood throughout the body.\\n  * **Blood clots.** Blood clots may form in the lining of the heart. A blood clot that forms on the right side of the heart can travel to the lungs (pulmonary embolism). If a clot blocks blood flow, you could have a heart attack or stroke.\\n  * **Leaky heart valve (regurgitation).** Heart enlargement may prevent the mitral and tricuspid heart valves from closing, causing blood to leak backward. The interrupted blood flow creates a sound called a heart murmur. Although not necessarily harmful, heart murmurs should be monitored by a health care provider.\\n  * **Cardiac arrest and sudden death.** An enlarged heart may cause the heart to beat too fast or too slow. The irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia) may lead to fainting, cardiac arrest or sudden death.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n## Prevention\\n\\nTell your health care provider if anyone in your family has or had\\ncardiomyopathy or other health conditions that caused an enlarged heart. When\\ndiagnosed early, proper treatment of the underlying condition may prevent the\\nenlarged heart from getting worse.\\n\\nFollowing a heart-healthy lifestyle can help prevent or manage some conditions\\nthat can lead to an enlarged heart. Take these steps to help prevent an\\nenlarged heart:\\n\\n  * Monitor and manage high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes.\\n  * Take any prescribed medications as directed.\\n  * Eat a nutritious, balanced diet.\\n  * Get regular exercise.\\n  * Avoid or limit alcohol.\\n  * Don\\'t smoke.\\n  * Don\\'t use illegal drugs.\\n\\n\\n  * CT scan\\n\\nShow more associated procedures\\n\\n  * Echocardiogram\\n\\n  * Electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG)\\n\\n  * Heart transplant\\n\\n  * Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs)\\n\\n  * MRI\\n\\n  * Pacemaker\\n\\n  * Stress test\\n\\n  * Ventricular assist device\\n\\nCON-XXXXXXXX\\n\\nSkip Advertisement\\n\\n## Advertisement\\n\\nMayo Clinic does not endorse companies or products.

But\\nif the pericardium is diseased or injured, the resulting inflammation can lead\\nto excess fluid. Fluid can also build up around the heart without\\ninflammation, such as from bleeding, related to a cancer or after chest\\ntrauma.\\n\\nPericardial effusion can put pressure on the heart, affecting how the heart\\nworks. If untreated, it may lead to heart failure or death in extreme cases.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n## Symptoms\\n\\nPericardial effusion may not cause any noticeable signs and symptoms,\\nparticularly if the fluid has increased slowly.\\n\\nIf pericardial effusion signs and symptoms do occur, they might include:\\n\\n  * Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing (dyspnea)\\n  * Discomfort when breathing while lying down\\n  * Chest pain, usually behind the breastbone or on the left side of the chest\\n  * Chest fullness\\n  * Lightheadedness or feeling faint\\n  * Swelling in the abdomen or legs\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n## When to see a doctor\\n\\nCall 911 or your local emergency number if you feel chest pain that lasts more\\nthan a few minutes, if your breathing is difficult or painful, or if you have\\nan unexplained fainting spell.\\n\\nSee your health care provider if you have shortness of breath.\\n\\nRequest an appointment\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n## Causes\\n\\nPericardial effusion can result from inflammation of the pericardium\\n(pericarditis) after an illness or injury. In some settings, large effusions\\nmay be caused by certain cancers. A blockage of pericardial fluids or a\\ncollection of blood within the pericardium also can lead to this condition.\\n\\nSometimes the cause can't be determined (idiopathic pericarditis).\\n\\nCauses of pericardial effusion may include:\\n\\n  * Autoimmune disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus\\n  * Cancer of the heart or pericardium\\n  * Spread of cancer (metastasis), particularly lung cancer, breast cancer or Hodgkin's lymphoma\\n  * Radiation therapy for cancer if the heart was in the area of the radiation\\n  * Chest trauma\\n  * Inflammation of the pericardium following a heart attack or after heart surgery or a procedure where the heart's lining is injured\\n  * Underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism)\\n  * Use of certain drugs or exposure to toxins\\n  * Viral, bacterial, fungal or parasitic infections\\n  * Waste products in the blood due to kidney failure (uremia)\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n## Complications\\n\\nA potential complication of pericardial effusion is cardiac tamponade (tam-\\npon-AYD). In this condition, the excess fluid within the pericardium puts\\npressure on the heart. The strain prevents the heart chambers from filling\\ncompletely with blood.\\n\\nCardiac tamponade results in poor blood flow and a lack of oxygen to the body.\\nCardiac tamponade is life-threatening and requires emergency medical\\ntreatment.\\n\\nRequest an appointment\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nBy Mayo Clinic Staff\\n\\nNov 13, 2021\\n\\nPrint\\n\\nShow References\\n\\n  1.

It's called alpha-1-antitrypsin\\ndeficiency emphysema.\\n\\n## \\n---------------------\\nContent for topic 'causes':\\ncauses\\n\\n  * Diagnosis &  \\ntreatment\\n\\n  * Doctors &  \\ndepartments\\n\\nPrint\\n\\n## Overview\\n\\nEmphysema Enlarge image\\n\\nClose\\n\\n### Emphysema\\n\\n### Emphysema\\n\\nIn emphysema, the inner walls of the lungs' air sacs (alveoli) are damaged,\\ncausing them to eventually rupture. This creates one larger air space instead\\nof many small ones and reduces the surface area available for gas exchange.\\n\\nEmphysema is a lung condition that causes shortness of breath. In people with\\nemphysema, the air sacs in the lungs (alveoli) are damaged. Over time, the\\ninner walls of the air sacs weaken and rupture -- creating larger air spaces\\ninstead of many small ones. This reduces the surface area of the lungs and, in\\nturn, the amount of oxygen that reaches your bloodstream.\\n\\nWhen you exhale, the damaged alveoli don't work properly and old air becomes\\ntrapped, leaving no room for fresh, oxygen-rich air to enter.\\n\\nMost people with emphysema also have chronic bronchitis. Chronic bronchitis is\\ninflammation of the tubes that carry air to your lungs (bronchial tubes),\\nwhich leads to a persistent cough.\\n\\nEmphysema and chronic bronchitis are two conditions that make up chronic\\nobstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Smoking is the leading cause of COPD.\\nTreatment may slow the progression of COPD, but it can't reverse the damage.\\n\\n### Products & Services\\n\\n  * A Book: Mayo Clinic Family Health Book, 5th Edition\\n  * Newsletter: Mayo Clinic Health Letter -- Digital Edition\\n\\nShow more products from Mayo Clinic\\n\\n## Symptoms\\n\\nYou can have emphysema for many years without noticing any signs or symptoms.\\nThe main symptom of emphysema is shortness of breath, which usually begins\\ngradually.\\n\\nYou may start avoiding activities that cause you to be short of breath, so the\\nsymptom doesn't become a problem until it starts interfering with daily tasks.\\nEmphysema eventually causes shortness of breath even while you're at rest.\\n\\n#### \\n---------------------\\nContent for topic 'risk factors':\\nRisk factors\\n\\nFactors that increase your risk of developing emphysema include:\\n\\n  * **Smoking.** Emphysema is most likely to develop in cigarette smokers, but cigar and pipe smokers also are susceptible. The risk for all types of smokers increases with the number of years and amount of tobacco smoked.\\n  * **Age.** Although the lung damage that occurs in emphysema develops gradually, most people with tobacco-related emphysema begin to experience symptoms of the disease between the ages of 40 and 60.\\n  * **Exposure to secondhand smoke.** Secondhand smoke, also known as passive or environmental tobacco smoke, is smoke that you inadvertently inhale from someone else's cigarette, pipe or cigar. Being around secondhand smoke increases your risk of emphysema.\\n  * **Occupational exposure to fumes or dust.** If you breathe fumes from certain chemicals or dust from grain, cotton, wood or mining products, you're more likely to develop emphysema. This risk is even greater if you smoke.\\n  * **Exposure to indoor and outdoor pollution.** Breathing indoor pollutants, such as fumes from heating fuel, as well as outdoor pollutants -- car exhaust, for instance -- increases your risk of emphysema.\\n\\n## \\n---------------------\\nContent for topic 'complications':\\nComplications\\n\\nPeople who have emphysema are also more likely to develop:\\n\\n  * **Collapsed lung (pneumothorax).** A collapsed lung can be life-threatening in people who have severe emphysema, because the function of their lungs is already so compromised. This is uncommon but serious when it occurs.\\n  * **Heart problems.** Emphysema can increase the pressure in the arteries that connect the heart and lungs. This can cause a condition called cor pulmonale, in which a section of the heart expands and weakens.\\n  * **Large holes in the lungs (bullae).** Some people with emphysema develop empty spaces in the lungs called bullae. They can be as large as half the lung. In addition to reducing the amount of space available for the lung to expand, giant bullae can increase your risk of pneumothorax.\\n\\n### More Information\\n\\n  * Hyperinflated lungs: What does it mean?\\n\\n## \\n---------------------\\nContent for topic 'prevention':\\nPrevention\\n\\nTo prevent emphysema, don't smoke and avoid breathing secondhand smoke.

The most common are bacteria and viruses in\\nthe air we breathe. Your body usually prevents these germs from infecting your\\nlungs. But sometimes these germs can overpower your immune system, even if\\nyour health is generally good.\\n\\nPneumonia is classified according to the types of germs that cause it and\\nwhere you got the infection.\\n\\n#### Community-acquired pneumonia\\n\\nCommunity-acquired pneumonia is the most common type of pneumonia. It occurs\\noutside of hospitals or other health care facilities. It may be caused by:\\n\\n  * **Bacteria.** The most common cause of bacterial pneumonia in the U.S. is Streptococcus pneumoniae. This type of pneumonia can occur on its own or after you've had a cold or the flu. It may affect one part (lobe) of the lung, a condition called lobar pneumonia.\\n  * **Bacteria-like organisms.** Mycoplasma pneumoniae also can cause pneumonia. It typically produces milder symptoms than do other types of pneumonia. Walking pneumonia is an informal name given to this type of pneumonia, which typically isn't severe enough to require bed rest.\\n  * **Fungi.** This type of pneumonia is most common in people with chronic health problems or weakened immune systems, and in people who have inhaled large doses of the organisms. The fungi that cause it can be found in soil or bird droppings and vary depending upon geographic location.\\n  * **Viruses, including COVID-19.** Some of the viruses that cause colds and the flu can cause pneumonia. Viruses are the most common cause of pneumonia in children younger than 5 years. Viral pneumonia is usually mild. But in some cases it can become very serious. Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) may cause pneumonia, which can become severe. \\n\\n#### Hospital-acquired pneumonia\\n\\nSome people catch pneumonia during a hospital stay for another illness.\\nHospital-acquired pneumonia can be serious because the bacteria causing it may\\nbe more resistant to antibiotics and because the people who get it are already\\nsick. People who are on breathing machines (ventilators), often used in\\nintensive care units, are at higher risk of this type of pneumonia.\\n\\n#### Health care-acquired pneumonia\\n\\nHealth care-acquired pneumonia is a bacterial infection that occurs in people\\nwho live in long-term care facilities or who receive care in outpatient\\nclinics, including kidney dialysis centers. Like hospital-acquired pneumonia,\\nhealth care-acquired pneumonia can be caused by bacteria that are more\\nresistant to antibiotics.\\n\\n#### Aspiration pneumonia\\n\\nAspiration pneumonia occurs when you inhale food, drink, vomit or saliva into\\nyour lungs. Aspiration is more likely if something disturbs your normal gag\\nreflex, such as a brain injury or swallowing problem, or excessive use of\\nalcohol or drugs.\\n\\n## \\n---------------------\\nContent for topic 'causes':\\ncauses\\n\\n  * Diagnosis &  \\ntreatment\\n\\n  * Doctors &  \\ndepartments\\n\\nPrint\\n\\n## Overview\\n\\nPneumonia and your lungs Enlarge image\\n\\nClose\\n\\n### Pneumonia and your lungs\\n\\n### Pneumonia and your lungs\\n\\nMost pneumonia occurs when a breakdown in your body's natural defenses allows\\ngerms to invade and multiply within your lungs. To destroy the attacking\\norganisms, white blood cells rapidly accumulate. Along with bacteria and\\nfungi, they fill the air sacs within your lungs (alveoli). Breathing may be\\nlabored. A classic sign of bacterial pneumonia is a cough that produces thick,\\nblood-tinged or yellowish-greenish sputum with pus.\\n\\nPneumonia is an infection that inflames the air sacs in one or both lungs. The\\nair sacs may fill with fluid or pus (purulent material), causing cough with\\nphlegm or pus, fever, chills, and difficulty breathing. A variety of\\norganisms, including bacteria, viruses and fungi, can cause pneumonia.\\n\\nPneumonia can range in seriousness from mild to life-threatening. It is most\\nserious for infants and young children, people older than age 65, and people\\nwith health problems or weakened immune systems.\\n\\n### Products & Services\\n\\n  * A Book: Living Medicine\\n\\n## Symptoms\\n\\nThe signs and symptoms of pneumonia vary from mild to severe, depending on\\nfactors such as the type of germ causing the infection, and your age and\\noverall health. Mild signs and symptoms often are similar to those of a cold\\nor flu, but they last longer.\\n\\nSigns and symptoms of pneumonia may include:\\n\\n  * Chest pain when you breathe or cough\\n  * Confusion or changes in mental awareness (in adults age 65 and older)\\n  * Cough, which may produce phlegm\\n  * Fatigue\\n  * Fever, sweating and shaking chills\\n  * Lower than normal body temperature (in adults older than age 65 and people with weak immune systems)\\n  * Nausea, vomiting or diarrhea\\n  * Shortness of breath\\n\\nNewborns and infants may not show any sign of the infection. Or they may\\nvomit, have a fever and cough, appear restless or tired and without energy, or\\nhave difficulty breathing and eating.\\n\\n#### \\n---------------------\\nContent for topic 'risk factors':\\nRisk factors\\n\\nPneumonia can affect anyone. But the two age groups at highest risk are:\\n\\n  * Children who are 2 years old or younger\\n  * People who are age 65 or older\\n\\nOther risk factors include:\\n\\n  * **Being hospitalized.** You're at greater risk of pneumonia if you're in a hospital intensive care unit, especially if you're on a machine that helps you breathe (a ventilator).\\n  * **Chronic disease.** You're more likely to get pneumonia if you have asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or heart disease.\\n  * **Smoking.** Smoking damages your body's natural defenses against the bacteria and viruses that cause pneumonia.\\n  * **Weakened or suppressed immune system.** People who have HIV/AIDS, who've had an organ transplant, or who receive chemotherapy or long-term steroids are at risk.\\n\\n## \\n---------------------\\nContent for topic 'complications':\\nComplications\\n\\nEven with treatment, some people with pneumonia, especially those in high-risk\\ngroups, may experience complications, including:\\n\\n  * **Bacteria in the bloodstream (bacteremia).** Bacteria that enter the bloodstream from your lungs can spread the infection to other organs, potentially causing organ failure.\\n  * **Difficulty breathing.** If your pneumonia is severe or you have chronic underlying lung diseases, you may have trouble breathing in enough oxygen. You may need to be hospitalized and use a breathing machine (ventilator) while your lung heals.\\n  * **Fluid accumulation around the lungs (pleural effusion).** Pneumonia may cause fluid to build up in the thin space between layers of tissue that line the lungs and chest cavity (pleura). If the fluid becomes infected, you may need to have it drained through a chest tube or removed with surgery.\\n  * **Lung abscess.** An abscess occurs if pus forms in a cavity in the lung. An abscess is usually treated with antibiotics. Sometimes, surgery or drainage with a long needle or tube placed into the abscess is needed to remove the pus.\\n\\n## \\n---------------------\\nContent for topic 'prevention':\\nPrevention\\n\\nTo help prevent pneumonia:\\n\\n  * **Get vaccinated.** Vaccines are available to prevent some types of pneumonia and the flu. Talk with your doctor about getting these shots. The \\n---------------------\\nContent for topic 'vaccination':\\nvaccination guidelines have changed over time so make sure to review your vaccination status with your doctor even if you recall previously receiving a pneumonia vaccine.\\n  * **Make sure children get vaccinated.** Doctors recommend a different pneumonia vaccine for children younger than age 2 and for children ages 2 to 5 years who are at particular risk of pneumococcal disease. Children who attend a group child care center should also get the vaccine. Doctors also recommend flu shots for children older than 6 months.\\n  * **Practice good hygiene.** To protect yourself against respiratory infections that sometimes lead to pneumonia, wash your hands regularly or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.\\n  * **Don't smoke.** Smoking damages your lungs' natural defenses against respiratory infections.\\n  * **Keep your immune system strong.** Get enough sleep, exercise regularly and eat a healthy diet.\\n\\n##\\n\", \"\\n\\n# Pneumothorax\\n\\nRequest an Appointment\\n\\n  * Symptoms &  \\n\\n---------------------\\nContent for topic 'when to see a doctor':\\nWhen to see a doctor\\n\\nSymptoms of a pneumothorax can be caused by a variety of health problems, and\\nsome can be life-threatening, so seek medical attention.

Some injuries may happen during physical assaults or car crashes, while others may inadvertently occur during medical procedures that involve the insertion of a needle into the chest.\\n  * **Lung disease.** Damaged lung tissue is more likely to collapse. Lung damage can be caused by many types of underlying diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis, lung cancer or pneumonia. Cystic lung diseases, such as lymphangioleiomyomatosis and Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome, cause round, thin-walled air sacs in the lung tissue that can rupture, resulting in pneumothorax.\\n  * **Ruptured air blisters.** Small air blisters (blebs) can develop on the top of the lungs. These air blisters sometimes burst -- allowing air to leak into the space that surrounds the lungs.\\n  * **Mechanical ventilation.** A severe type of pneumothorax can occur in people who need mechanical assistance to breathe. The ventilator can create an imbalance of air pressure within the chest. The lung may collapse completely.\\n\\n## \\n---------------------\\nContent for topic 'causes':\\ncauses\\n\\n  * Diagnosis &  \\ntreatment\\n\\n  * Doctors &  \\ndepartments\\n\\n  * Care at  \\nMayo Clinic\\n\\nPrint\\n\\n## Overview\\n\\nCollapsed and normal lung Enlarge image\\n\\nClose\\n\\n### Collapsed and normal lung\\n\\n### Collapsed and normal lung\\n\\nIn a collapsed lung, air from the lung leaks into the chest cavity. The\\nexample shown is a complete left pneumothorax.\\n\\nA pneumothorax (noo-moe-THOR-aks) is a collapsed lung. A pneumothorax occurs\\nwhen air leaks into the space between your lung and chest wall. This air\\npushes on the outside of your lung and makes it collapse. A pneumothorax can\\nbe a complete lung collapse or a collapse of only a portion of the lung.\\n\\nA pneumothorax can be caused by a blunt or penetrating chest injury, certain\\nmedical procedures, or damage from underlying lung disease. Or it may occur\\nfor no obvious reason. Symptoms usually include sudden chest pain and\\nshortness of breath. On some occasions, a collapsed lung can be a life-\\nthreatening event.\\n\\nTreatment for a pneumothorax usually involves inserting a needle or chest tube\\nbetween the ribs to remove the excess air. However, a small pneumothorax may\\nheal on its own.\\n\\n### Products & Services\\n\\n  * A Book: Mayo Clinic Family Health Book, 5th Edition\\n  * Newsletter: Mayo Clinic Health Letter -- Digital Edition\\n\\nShow more products from Mayo Clinic\\n\\n## Symptoms\\n\\nThe main symptoms of a pneumothorax are sudden chest pain and shortness of\\nbreath. Severity of symptoms may depend on how much of the lung is collapsed.\\n\\n### \\n---------------------\\nContent for topic 'risk factors':\\nRisk factors\\n\\nIn general, men are far more likely to have a pneumothorax than women are. The\\ntype of pneumothorax caused by ruptured air blisters is most likely to occur\\nin people between 20 and 40 years old, especially if the person is very tall\\nand underweight.\\n\\nUnderlying lung disease or mechanical ventilation can be a cause or a risk\\nfactor for a pneumothorax. Other risk factors include:\\n\\n  * **Smoking.** The risk increases with the length of time and the number of cigarettes smoked, even without emphysema.\\n  * **Genetics.** Certain types of pneumothorax appear to run in families.\\n  * **Previous pneumothorax.** Anyone who has had one pneumothorax is at increased risk of another.\\n\\n## \\n---------------------\\nContent for topic 'complications':\\nComplications\\n\\nPotential complications vary, depending on the size and severity of the\\npneumothorax as well as the cause and treatment. Sometimes air may continue to\\nleak if the opening in the lung won't close or pneumothorax may recur.\\n\\n##\\n\\nBy Mayo Clinic Staff\\n\\nPneumothorax care at Mayo Clinic\\n\\nRequest an appointment\\n\\nDiagnosis & treatment\\n\\nMay 21, 2021\\n\\nPrint\\n\\nShow references\\n\\n  1.

These changes make it harder for\\noxygen to pass into the bloodstream.\\n\\nDamage to the lungs that results in pulmonary fibrosis may be caused by many\\ndifferent things. Examples include long-term exposure to certain toxins,\\nradiation therapy, some medicines and certain medical conditions. In some\\ncases, the cause of pulmonary fibrosis is not known.\\n\\n### Your work and surroundings\\n\\nThe type of work you do and where you work or live could be the cause or part\\nof the cause for pulmonary fibrosis. Having continuous or repeated contact\\nwith toxins or pollutants -- substances that harm the quality of water, air or\\nland -- can damage your lungs, especially if you do not wear protective gear.\\nExamples include:\\n\\n  * Silica dust.\\n  * Asbestos fibers.\\n  * Hard metal dusts.\\n  * Wood, coal and grain dusts.\\n  * Mold.\\n  * Bird and animal droppings.\\n\\n### Radiation treatments\\n\\nSome people who receive radiation therapy to the chest, such as for lung or\\nbreast cancer, show signs of lung damage months or sometimes years after\\ntreatment. How severe the damage is may depend on:\\n\\n  * How much of the lung was exposed to radiation.\\n  * The total amount of radiation given.\\n  * Whether chemotherapy also was used.\\n  * Whether there is underlying lung disease.\\n\\n### Medicines\\n\\nMany medicines can damage the lungs. Some examples include:\\n\\n  * **Chemotherapy.** Medicines designed to kill cancer cells, such as methotrexate (Trexall, Otrexup, others), bleomycin and cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan), can damage lung tissue.\\n  * **Heart medicines.** Some medicines used to treat irregular heartbeats, such as amiodarone (Nexterone, Pacerone), may harm lung tissue.\\n  * **Some antibiotics.** Antibiotics such as nitrofurantoin (Macrobid, Macrodantin) or ethambutol (Myambutol) can cause lung damage.\\n  * **Anti-inflammatory medicines.** Certain anti-inflammatory medicines such as rituximab (Rituxan) or sulfasalazine (Azulfidine) can cause lung damage.\\n\\n### Medical conditions\\n\\nLung damage can also result from a number of conditions, including:\\n\\n  * **Dermatomyositis,** an inflammatory disease marked by muscle weakness and a skin rash.\\n  * **Lupus,** a disease that occurs when the body's immune system attacks its own tissues and organs.\\n  * **Mixed connective tissue disease,** which has a mix of symptoms of different disorders, such as lupus, scleroderma and polymyositis.\\n  * **Pneumonia,** an infection that inflames the air sacs in one or both lungs.\\n  * **Polymyositis,** an inflammatory disease that causes muscle weakness on both sides of the body.\\n  * **Rheumatoid arthritis,** an inflammatory disease that affects joints and other body systems.\\n  * **Sarcoidosis,** an inflammatory disease that most often affects the lungs and lymph nodes.\\n  * **Scleroderma,** a group of rare diseases that involve hardening and tightening of the skin as well as problems inside the body.\\n\\n### Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis\\n\\nMany substances and conditions can lead to pulmonary fibrosis. Even so, in\\nmany people, the cause is never found.

A healthy lung with\\nhealthy alveoli is shown on the left.\\n\\nPulmonary fibrosis is a lung disease that occurs when lung tissue becomes\\ndamaged and scarred. This thickened, stiff tissue makes it harder for the\\nlungs to work properly. Pulmonary fibrosis worsens over time. Some people can\\nstay stable for a long time, but the condition gets worse faster in others. As\\nit gets worse, people become more and more short of breath.\\n\\nThe scarring that happens in pulmonary fibrosis can be caused by many things.\\nOften, doctors and other healthcare professionals cannot pinpoint what's\\ncausing the problem. When a cause cannot be found, the condition is called\\nidiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.\\n\\nIdiopathic pulmonary fibrosis usually occurs in middle-aged and older adults.\\nSometimes pulmonary fibrosis is diagnosed in children and infants, but this is\\nnot common.\\n\\nThe lung damage caused by pulmonary fibrosis cannot be repaired. Medicines and\\ntherapies can sometimes help slow down the rate of fibrosis, ease symptoms and\\nimprove quality of life. For some people, a lung transplant might be an\\noption.\\n\\nPulmonary fibrosis care at Mayo Clinic\\n\\n### Products & Services\\n\\n  * A Book: Mayo Clinic Family Health Book, 5th Edition\\n  * Newsletter: Mayo Clinic Health Letter -- Digital Edition\\n\\nShow more products from Mayo Clinic\\n\\n## Symptoms\\n\\nSymptoms of pulmonary fibrosis may include:\\n\\n  * Shortness of breath.\\n  * Dry cough.\\n  * Extreme tiredness.\\n  * Weight loss that's not intended.\\n  * Aching muscles and joints.\\n  * Widening and rounding of the tips of the fingers or toes, called clubbing.\\n\\nHow fast pulmonary fibrosis worsens over time and how severe the symptoms are\\ncan vary greatly from person to person. Some people become ill very quickly\\nwith severe disease. Others have moderate symptoms that worsen more slowly,\\nover months or years.\\n\\n### When symptoms suddenly get worse\\n\\nIn people with pulmonary fibrosis, especially idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis,\\nshortness of breath can suddenly get worse over a few weeks or days. This is\\ncalled an acute exacerbation. It can be life-threatening. The cause of an\\nacute exacerbation may be another condition or an illness, such as a lung\\ninfection. But usually the cause is not known.\\n\\n### \\n---------------------\\nContent for topic 'risk factors':\\nrisk factors such as smoking or\\nexposure to air pollution could be related to the condition, even if the cause\\ncannot be confirmed. Pulmonary fibrosis with no known cause is called\\nidiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.\\n\\nMany people with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis also may have gastroesophageal\\nreflux disease, also called GERD. This condition occurs when acid from the\\nstomach flows back into the esophagus. GERD may be a risk factor for\\nidiopathic pulmonary fibrosis or cause the condition to worsen faster. But\\nmore studies are needed.\\n\\n## Risk factors\\n\\nPulmonary fibrosis has been found in children and infants, but this is not\\ncommon. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is much more likely to affect middle-\\naged and older adults. Other types of pulmonary fibrosis, such as that caused\\nby connective tissue disease, can occur in younger people.\\n\\nFactors that can raise your risk of pulmonary fibrosis include:\\n\\n  * **Smoking.** If you smoke now or used to smoke, you're at a higher risk of pulmonary fibrosis than people who never smoked. People with emphysema are at higher risk, too.\\n  * **Certain types of work.** You have a higher risk of developing pulmonary fibrosis if you work in mining, farming or construction. The risk also is higher if you have continuous or repeated contact with pollutants known to damage the lungs.\\n  * **Cancer treatments.** Having radiation treatments to your chest or using certain chemotherapy medicines can raise your risk of pulmonary fibrosis.\\n  * **Genetics.** Some types of pulmonary fibrosis run in families, so genes may play a role.\\n\\n## \\n---------------------\\nContent for topic 'complications':\\nComplications\\n\\nComplications of pulmonary fibrosis may include:\\n\\n  * **High blood pressure in the lungs.** Called pulmonary hypertension, this type of high blood pressure affects the arteries in the lungs. These are the pulmonary arteries. Stiff and thick arteries may slow down or block blood flow through the lungs. This raises the pressure inside the pulmonary arteries and the lower right heart chamber, called the right ventricle.\\n  * **Right-sided heart failure.** This serious condition occurs when your heart's right chamber has to pump harder than usual to move blood through partly blocked pulmonary arteries.\\n  * **Respiratory failure.** This is often the last stage of long-term lung disease. It occurs when blood oxygen levels fall dangerously low.\\n  * **Lung cancer.** Long-standing pulmonary fibrosis increases your risk of developing lung cancer.\\n  * **Other lung problems.** As pulmonary fibrosis gets worse over time, it may lead to serious problems such as blood clots in the lungs, a collapsed lung or lung infections.\\n\\n##\\n\", \"\\n\\nDiseases & Conditions\\n\\n  1.

The\\ngerms that cause tuberculosis are a type of bacteria.\\n\\nTuberculosis can spread when a person with the illness coughs, sneezes or\\nsings. This can put tiny droplets with the germs into the air. Another person\\ncan then breathe in the droplets, and the germs enter the lungs.\\n\\nTuberculosis spreads easily where people gather in crowds or where people live\\nin crowded conditions. People with HIV/AIDS and other people with weakened\\nimmune systems have a higher risk of catching tuberculosis than people with\\ntypical immune systems.\\n\\nDrugs called antibiotics can treat tuberculosis. But some forms of the\\nbacteria no longer respond well to treatments.\\n\\n### Products & Services\\n\\n  * A Book: Mayo Clinic Family Health Book, 5th Edition\\n\\n  * Newsletter: Mayo Clinic Health Letter — Digital Edition\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n## Symptoms\\n\\nWhen tuberculosis (TB) germs survive and multiply in the lungs, it is called a\\nTB infection. A TB infection may be in one of three stages. Symptoms are\\ndifferent in each stage.\\n\\n **Primary TB infection.** The first stage is called the primary infection.\\nImmune system cells find and capture the germs. The immune system may\\ncompletely destroy the germs. But some captured germs may still survive and\\nmultiply.\\n\\nMost people don't have symptoms during a primary infection. Some people may\\nget flu-like symptoms, such as:\\n\\n  * Low fever.\\n  * Tiredness.\\n  * Cough.\\n\\n**Latent TB infection.** Primary infection is usually followed by the stage\\ncalled latent TB infection. Immune system cells build a wall around lung\\ntissue with TB germs. The germs can't do any more harm if the immune system\\nkeeps them under control. But the germs survive. There are no symptoms during\\nlatent TB infection.\\n\\n **Active TB disease.** Active TB disease happens when the immune system can't\\ncontrol an infection. Germs cause disease throughout the lungs or other parts\\nof the body. Active TB disease may happen right after primary infection. But\\nit usually happens after months or years of latent TB infection.\\n\\nSymptoms of active TB disease in the lungs usually begin gradually and worsen\\nover a few weeks. They may include:\\n\\n  * Cough.\\n  * Coughing up blood or mucus.\\n  * Chest pain.\\n  * Pain with breathing or coughing.\\n  * Fever.\\n  * Chills.\\n  * Night sweats.\\n  * Weight loss.\\n  * Not wanting to eat.\\n  * Tiredness.\\n  * Not feeling well in general.\\n\\n**Active TB disease outside the lungs.** TB infection can spread from the\\nlungs to other parts of the body. This is called extrapulmonary tuberculosis.\\nSymptoms vary depending on what part of the body is infected. Common symptoms\\nmay include:\\n\\n  * Fever.\\n  * Chills.\\n  * Night sweats.\\n  * Weight loss.\\n  * Not wanting to eat.\\n  * Tiredness.\\n  * Not feeling well in general.\\n  * Pain near the site of infection.\\n\\nActive TB disease in the voice box is outside the lungs, but it has symptoms\\nmore like disease in the lungs.\\n\\nCommon sites of active TB disease outside the lungs include:\\n\\n  * Kidneys.\\n  * Liver.\\n  * Fluid surrounding the brain and spinal cord.\\n  * Heart muscles.\\n  * Genitals.\\n  * Lymph nodes.\\n  * Bones and joints.\\n  * Skin.\\n  * Walls of blood vessels.\\n  * Voice box, also called larynx.\\n\\n**Active TB disease in children.** Symptoms of active TB disease in children\\nvary. Typically, symptoms by age may include the following:\\n\\n  * **Teenagers.** Symptoms are similar to adult symptoms.\\n  * **1- to 12-year-olds.** Younger children may have a fever that won't go away and weight loss.\\n  * **Infants.** The baby doesn't grow or gain weight as expected. Also, a baby may have symptoms from swelling in the fluid around the brain or spinal cord, including: \\n    * Being sluggish or not active.\\n    * Unusually fussy.\\n    * Vomiting.\\n    * Poor feeding.\\n    * Bulging soft spot on the head.\\n    * Poor reflexes.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n## When to see a doctor\\n\\nThe symptoms of tuberculosis are similar to symptoms of many different\\nillnesses. See your health care provider if you have symptoms that don't\\nimprove with a few days of rest.\\n\\nGet emergency care if you have:\\n\\n  * Chest pain.\\n  * Sudden, severe headache.\\n  * Confusion.\\n  * Seizures.\\n  * Difficulty breathing.\\n\\nGet immediate or urgent care if you:\\n\\n  * Cough up blood.\\n  * Have blood in your urine or stool.\\n\\nRequest an appointment\\n\\n## From Mayo Clinic to your inbox\\n\\nSign up for free and stay up to date on research advancements, health tips,\\ncurrent health topics, and expertise on managing health.

They release tiny droplets that carry the bacteria through the air.\\nThis can happen when they're speaking, singing, laughing, coughing or\\nsneezing. A person can get an infection after inhaling the droplets.\\n\\nThe disease is more likely to spread when people spend a lot of time together\\nin an indoor space. So the disease spreads easily in places where people live\\nor work together for long periods. Also, the disease spreads more easily in\\ncrowded gatherings.\\n\\nA person with a latent TB infection cannot pass the disease to other people. A\\nperson taking drugs to treat active TB disease usually can't pass the disease\\nafter 2 to 3 weeks of treatment.\\n\\n### Drug-resistant TB\\n\\nSome forms of the TB bacteria have become drug resistant. This means that\\ndrugs that once cured the disease no longer work.\\n\\nThis happens, in part, because of naturally occurring genetic changes in\\nbacteria. A random genetic change in a bacterium might give it some quality\\nthat makes it more likely to survive the attack of an antibiotic. If it does\\nsurvive, then it can multiply.\\n\\nWhen antibiotic drugs aren't used correctly — or drugs fail to kill all the\\nbacteria for another reason — the conditions are ideal for more-resistant\\nversions of the bacteria to get established and multiply. If these bacteria\\nare passed on to other people, a new drug-resistant strain can grow over time.\\n\\nProblems that can lead to such drug-resistant strains of bacteria include the\\nfollowing:\\n\\n  * People didn't follow directions for taking the drugs or stopped taking the drugs.\\n  * They weren't prescribed the right treatment plan.\\n  * Drugs were not available.\\n  * The drugs were of poor quality.\\n  * The body didn't absorb the drugs as expected.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n## Risk factors\\n\\nAnyone can get tuberculosis, but certain factors increase the risk of getting\\nan infection. Other factors increase the risk of an infection becoming active\\nTB disease.\\n\\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends a TB test for people\\nwho have an increased risk of TB infection or active TB disease. Talk to your\\nhealth care provider if you have one or more of the following risk factors.\\n\\n### Risk of TB infection\\n\\nCertain living or working conditions make it easier for the disease to pass\\nfrom one person to another. These conditions increase the risk of getting a TB\\ninfection:\\n\\n  * Living with someone with active TB disease.\\n  * Living or traveling in a country where TB is common, including several countries in Latin America, Africa, Asia and the Pacific Islands.\\n  * Living or working in places where people live close together, such as prisons, nursing homes and shelters for homeless people.\\n  * Living in a community identified as being at high risk of tuberculosis.\\n  * Working in health care and treating people with a high risk of TB.\\n\\n### Risk of active TB disease\\n\\nA weakened immune system increases the risk of a TB infection becoming active\\nTB disease. Conditions or treatments that weaken the immune system include:\\n\\n  * HIV/AIDS.\\n  * Diabetes.\\n  * Severe kidney disease.\\n  * Cancers of the head, neck and blood.\\n  * Malnutrition or low body weight.\\n  * Cancer treatment, such as chemotherapy.\\n  * Drugs to prevent rejection of transplanted organs.\\n  * Long-term use of prescription steroids.\\n  * Use of unlawful injected drugs.\\n  * Misuse of alcohol.\\n  * Smoking and using other tobacco products.\\n\\n### Age and active TB disease\\n\\nThe risk of a TB infection becoming active TB disease changes with age.\\n\\n  * **Under 5 years of age.** Until children reach age 5, they have high risk of a TB infection becoming active TB disease. The risk is greater for children under age 2. Tuberculosis in this age group often leads to serious disease in the fluid surrounding the brain and spinal column, called meningitis.\\n  * **Age 15 to 25.** People in this age group have an increased risk of developing more-severe active TB disease in the lungs.\\n  * **Age 65 and older.** The immune system weakens during older age. Older adults have a greater risk of active TB disease. Also, the disease may be more difficult to treat.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n## Prevention\\n\\nIf you test positive for latent TB infection, you may need to take drugs to\\nprevent active TB disease.\\n\\n### Preventing the spread of disease\\n\\nIf you have active TB disease, you'll need to take steps to prevent other\\npeople from getting an infection. You will take drugs for four, six or nine\\nmonths. Take all of the drugs as directed during the entire time.\\n\\nDuring the first 2 to 3 weeks, you will be able to pass TB bacteria to others.\\nProtect others with these steps:\\n\\n  * **Stay home.** Don't go to work or school.\\n  * **Isolate at home.** Spend as little time as possible among members of your household. Sleep in a separate room.\\n  * **Ventilate the room.** Tuberculosis germs spread more easily in small, closed spaces. If it's not too cold outdoors, open the windows. Use a fan to blow air out. If you have more than one window, use one fan to blow air out and another to blow air in.\\n  * **Wear face masks.** Wear a mask when you have to be around other people. Ask other members of the household to wear masks to protect themselves.\\n  * **Cover your mouth.** Use a tissue to cover your mouth anytime you sneeze or cough. Put the dirty tissue in a bag, seal it and throw it away.\\n\\n### \\n---------------------\\nContent for topic 'vaccination':\\nVaccinations\\n\\nIn countries where tuberculosis is common, infants often are vaccinated with\\nthe bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine. This protects infants and toddlers\\nwho are more likely to have active TB disease in the fluid surrounding the\\nbrain and spinal cord.\\n\\nThe vaccine may not protect against disease in the lungs, which is more likely\\nin the United States. Dozens of new TB vaccines are in various stages of\\ndevelopment and testing.\\n\"]\n"

The most common are bacteria and viruses in\\nthe air we breathe. Your body usually prevents these germs from infecting your\\nlungs. But sometimes these germs can overpower your immune system, even if\\nyour health is generally good.\\n\\nPneumonia is classified according to the types of germs that cause it and\\nwhere you got the infection.\\n\\n#### Community-acquired pneumonia\\n\\nCommunity-acquired pneumonia is the most common type of pneumonia. It occurs\\noutside of hospitals or other health care facilities. It may be caused by:\\n\\n  * **Bacteria.** The most common cause of bacterial pneumonia in the U.S. is Streptococcus pneumoniae. This type of pneumonia can occur on its own or after you've had a cold or the flu. It may affect one part (lobe) of the lung, a condition called lobar pneumonia.\\n  * **Bacteria-like organisms.** Mycoplasma pneumoniae also can cause pneumonia. It typically produces milder symptoms than do other types of pneumonia. Walking pneumonia is an informal name given to this type of pneumonia, which typically isn't severe enough to require bed rest.\\n  * **Fungi.** This type of pneumonia is most common in people with chronic health problems or weakened immune systems, and in people who have inhaled large doses of the organisms. The fungi that cause it can be found in soil or bird droppings and vary depending upon geographic location.\\n  * **Viruses, including COVID-19.** Some of the viruses that cause colds and the flu can cause pneumonia. Viruses are the most common cause of pneumonia in children younger than 5 years. Viral pneumonia is usually mild. But in some cases it can become very serious. Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) may cause pneumonia, which can become severe. \\n\\n#### Hospital-acquired pneumonia\\n\\nSome people catch pneumonia during a hospital stay for another illness.\\nHospital-acquired pneumonia can be serious because the bacteria causing it may\\nbe more resistant to antibiotics and because the people who get it are already\\nsick. People who are on breathing machines (ventilators), often used in\\nintensive care units, are at higher risk of this type of pneumonia.\\n\\n#### Health care-acquired pneumonia\\n\\nHealth care-acquired pneumonia is a bacterial infection that occurs in people\\nwho live in long-term care facilities or who receive care in outpatient\\nclinics, including kidney dialysis centers. Like hospital-acquired pneumonia,\\nhealth care-acquired pneumonia can be caused by bacteria that are more\\nresistant to antibiotics.\\n\\n#### Aspiration pneumonia\\n\\nAspiration pneumonia occurs when you inhale food, drink, vomit or saliva into\\nyour lungs. Aspiration is more likely if something disturbs your normal gag\\nreflex, such as a brain injury or swallowing problem, or excessive use of\\nalcohol or drugs.\\n\\n## \\n---------------------\\nContent for topic 'causes':\\ncauses\\n\\n  * Diagnosis &  \\ntreatment\\n\\n  * Doctors &  \\ndepartments\\n\\nPrint\\n\\n## Overview\\n\\nPneumonia and your lungs Enlarge image\\n\\nClose\\n\\n### Pneumonia and your lungs\\n\\n### Pneumonia and your lungs\\n\\nMost pneumonia occurs when a breakdown in your body's natural defenses allows\\ngerms to invade and multiply within your lungs. To destroy the attacking\\norganisms, white blood cells rapidly accumulate. Along with bacteria and\\nfungi, they fill the air sacs within your lungs (alveoli). Breathing may be\\nlabored. A classic sign of bacterial pneumonia is a cough that produces thick,\\nblood-tinged or yellowish-greenish sputum with pus.\\n\\nPneumonia is an infection that inflames the air sacs in one or both lungs. The\\nair sacs may fill with fluid or pus (purulent material), causing cough with\\nphlegm or pus, fever, chills, and difficulty breathing. A variety of\\norganisms, including bacteria, viruses and fungi, can cause pneumonia.\\n\\nPneumonia can range in seriousness from mild to life-threatening. It is most\\nserious for infants and young children, people older than age 65, and people\\nwith health problems or weakened immune systems.\\n\\n### Products & Services\\n\\n  * A Book: Living Medicine\\n\\n## Symptoms\\n\\nThe signs and symptoms of pneumonia vary from mild to severe, depending on\\nfactors such as the type of germ causing the infection, and your age and\\noverall health.

The most common are bacteria and viruses in\\nthe air we breathe. Your body usually prevents these germs from infecting your\\nlungs. But sometimes these germs can overpower your immune system, even if\\nyour health is generally good.\\n\\nPneumonia is classified according to the types of germs that cause it and\\nwhere you got the infection.\\n\\n#### Community-acquired pneumonia\\n\\nCommunity-acquired pneumonia is the most common type of pneumonia. It occurs\\noutside of hospitals or other health care facilities. It may be caused by:\\n\\n  * **Bacteria.** The most common cause of bacterial pneumonia in the U.S. is Streptococcus pneumoniae. This type of pneumonia can occur on its own or after you've had a cold or the flu. It may affect one part (lobe) of the lung, a condition called lobar pneumonia.\\n  * **Bacteria-like organisms.** Mycoplasma pneumoniae also can cause pneumonia. It typically produces milder symptoms than do other types of pneumonia. Walking pneumonia is an informal name given to this type of pneumonia, which typically isn't severe enough to require bed rest.\\n  * **Fungi.** This type of pneumonia is most common in people with chronic health problems or weakened immune systems, and in people who have inhaled large doses of the organisms. The fungi that cause it can be found in soil or bird droppings and vary depending upon geographic location.\\n  * **Viruses, including COVID-19.** Some of the viruses that cause colds and the flu can cause pneumonia. Viruses are the most common cause of pneumonia in children younger than 5 years. Viral pneumonia is usually mild. But in some cases it can become very serious. Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) may cause pneumonia, which can become severe. \\n\\n#### Hospital-acquired pneumonia\\n\\nSome people catch pneumonia during a hospital stay for another illness.\\nHospital-acquired pneumonia can be serious because the bacteria causing it may\\nbe more resistant to antibiotics and because the people who get it are already\\nsick. People who are on breathing machines (ventilators), often used in\\nintensive care units, are at higher risk of this type of pneumonia.\\n\\n#### Health care-acquired pneumonia\\n\\nHealth care-acquired pneumonia is a bacterial infection that occurs in people\\nwho live in long-term care facilities or who receive care in outpatient\\nclinics, including kidney dialysis centers. Like hospital-acquired pneumonia,\\nhealth care-acquired pneumonia can be caused by bacteria that are more\\nresistant to antibiotics.\\n\\n#### Aspiration pneumonia\\n\\nAspiration pneumonia occurs when you inhale food, drink, vomit or saliva into\\nyour lungs. Aspiration is more likely if something disturbs your normal gag\\nreflex, such as a brain injury or swallowing problem, or excessive use of\\nalcohol or drugs.\\n\\n## \\n---------------------\\nContent for topic 'causes':\\ncauses\\n\\n  * Diagnosis &  \\ntreatment\\n\\n  * Doctors &  \\ndepartments\\n\\nPrint\\n\\n## Overview\\n\\nPneumonia and your lungs Enlarge image\\n\\nClose\\n\\n### Pneumonia and your lungs\\n\\n### Pneumonia and your lungs\\n\\nMost pneumonia occurs when a breakdown in your body's natural defenses allows\\ngerms to invade and multiply within your lungs. To destroy the attacking\\norganisms, white blood cells rapidly accumulate. Along with bacteria and\\nfungi, they fill the air sacs within your lungs (alveoli). Breathing may be\\nlabored. A classic sign of bacterial pneumonia is a cough that produces thick,\\nblood-tinged or yellowish-greenish sputum with pus.\\n\\nPneumonia is an infection that inflames the air sacs in one or both lungs. The\\nair sacs may fill with fluid or pus (purulent material), causing cough with\\nphlegm or pus, fever, chills, and difficulty breathing. A variety of\\norganisms, including bacteria, viruses and fungi, can cause pneumonia.\\n\\nPneumonia can range in seriousness from mild to life-threatening. It is most\\nserious for infants and young children, people older than age 65, and people\\nwith health problems or weakened immune systems.\\n\\n### Products & Services\\n\\n  * A Book: Living Medicine\\n\\n## Symptoms\\n\\nThe signs and symptoms of pneumonia vary from mild to severe, depending on\\nfactors such as the type of germ causing the infection, and your age and\\noverall health.

The\\ngerms that cause tuberculosis are a type of bacteria.\\n\\nTuberculosis can spread when a person with the illness coughs, sneezes or\\nsings. This can put tiny droplets with the germs into the air.

People with HIV/AIDS and other people with weakened\\nimmune systems have a higher risk of catching tuberculosis than people with\\ntypical immune systems.\\n\\nDrugs called antibiotics can treat tuberculosis. But some forms of the\\nbacteria no longer respond well to treatments.\\n\\n### Products & Services\\n\\n  * A Book: Mayo Clinic Family Health Book, 5th Edition\\n\\n  * Newsletter: Mayo Clinic Health Letter — Digital Edition\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n## Symptoms\\n\\nWhen tuberculosis (TB) germs survive and multiply in the lungs, it is called a\\nTB infection. A TB infection may be in one of three stages. Symptoms are\\ndifferent in each stage.\\n\\n **Primary TB infection.** The first stage is called the primary infection.\\nImmune system cells find and capture the germs. The immune system may\\ncompletely destroy the germs. But some captured germs may still survive and\\nmultiply.\\n\\nMost people don't have symptoms during a primary infection. Some people may\\nget flu-like symptoms, such as:\\n\\n  * Low fever.\\n  * Tiredness.\\n  * Cough.\\n\\n**Latent TB infection.** Primary infection is usually followed by the stage\\ncalled latent TB infection. Immune system cells build a wall around lung\\ntissue with TB germs. The germs can't do any more harm if the immune system\\nkeeps them under control. But the germs survive. There are no symptoms during\\nlatent TB infection.\\n\\n **Active TB disease.** Active TB disease happens when the immune system can't\\ncontrol an infection. Germs cause disease throughout the lungs or other parts\\nof the body. Active TB disease may happen right after primary infection. But\\nit usually happens after months or years of latent TB infection.\\n\\nSymptoms of active TB disease in the lungs usually begin gradually and worsen\\nover a few weeks. They may include:\\n\\n  * Cough.\\n  * Coughing up blood or mucus.\\n  * Chest pain.\\n  * Pain with breathing or coughing.\\n  * Fever.\\n  * Chills.\\n  * Night sweats.\\n  * Weight loss.\\n  * Not wanting to eat.\\n  * Tiredness.\\n  * Not feeling well in general.\\n\\n**Active TB disease outside the lungs.** TB infection can spread from the\\nlungs to other parts of the body. This is called extrapulmonary tuberculosis.\\nSymptoms vary depending on what part of the body is infected. Common symptoms\\nmay include:\\n\\n  * Fever.\\n  * Chills.\\n  * Night sweats.\\n  * Weight loss.\\n  * Not wanting to eat.\\n  * Tiredness.\\n  * Not feeling well in general.\\n  * Pain near the site of infection.\\n\\nActive TB disease in the voice box is outside the lungs, but it has symptoms\\nmore like disease in the lungs.\\n\\nCommon sites of active TB disease outside the lungs include:\\n\\n  * Kidneys.\\n  * Liver.\\n  * Fluid surrounding the brain and spinal cord.\\n  * Heart muscles.\\n  * Genitals.\\n  * Lymph nodes.\\n  * Bones and joints.\\n  * Skin.\\n  * Walls of blood vessels.\\n  * Voice box, also called larynx.\\n\\n**Active TB disease in children.** Symptoms of active TB disease in children\\nvary. Typically, symptoms by age may include the following:\\n\\n  * **Teenagers.** Symptoms are similar to adult symptoms.\\n  * **1- to 12-year-olds.** Younger children may have a fever that won't go away and weight loss.\\n  * **Infants.** The baby doesn't grow or gain weight as expected. Also, a baby may have symptoms from swelling in the fluid around the brain or spinal cord, including: \\n    * Being sluggish or not active.\\n    * Unusually fussy.\\n    * Vomiting.\\n    * Poor feeding.\\n    * Bulging soft spot on the head.\\n    * Poor reflexes.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n## When to see a doctor\\n\\nThe symptoms of tuberculosis are similar to symptoms of many different\\nillnesses.

You may opt-out\\nof email communications at any time by clicking on the unsubscribe link in the\\ne-mail.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n## Causes\\n\\nTuberculosis is caused by a bacterium called Mycobacterium tuberculosis.\\n\\nPeople with active TB disease in the lungs or voice box can spread the\\ndisease. They release tiny droplets that carry the bacteria through the air.\\nThis can happen when they're speaking, singing, laughing, coughing or\\nsneezing. A person can get an infection after inhaling the droplets.\\n\\nThe disease is more likely to spread when people spend a lot of time together\\nin an indoor space. So the disease spreads easily in places where people live\\nor work together for long periods. Also, the disease spreads more easily in\\ncrowded gatherings.\\n\\nA person with a latent TB infection cannot pass the disease to other people. A\\nperson taking drugs to treat active TB disease usually can't pass the disease\\nafter 2 to 3 weeks of treatment.\\n\\n### Drug-resistant TB\\n\\nSome forms of the TB bacteria have become drug resistant. This means that\\ndrugs that once cured the disease no longer work.\\n\\nThis happens, in part, because of naturally occurring genetic changes in\\nbacteria. A random genetic change in a bacterium might give it some quality\\nthat makes it more likely to survive the attack of an antibiotic. If it does\\nsurvive, then it can multiply.\\n\\nWhen antibiotic drugs aren't used correctly — or drugs fail to kill all the\\nbacteria for another reason — the conditions are ideal for more-resistant\\nversions of the bacteria to get established and multiply. If these bacteria\\nare passed on to other people, a new drug-resistant strain can grow over time.\\n\\nProblems that can lead to such drug-resistant strains of bacteria include the\\nfollowing:\\n\\n  * People didn't follow directions for taking the drugs or stopped taking the drugs.\\n  * They weren't prescribed the right treatment plan.\\n  * Drugs were not available.\\n  * The drugs were of poor quality.\\n  * The body didn't absorb the drugs as expected.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n## Risk factors\\n\\nAnyone can get tuberculosis, but certain factors increase the risk of getting\\nan infection. Other factors increase the risk of an infection becoming active\\nTB disease.\\n\\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends a TB test for people\\nwho have an increased risk of TB infection or active TB disease. Talk to your\\nhealth care provider if you have one or more of the following risk factors.\\n\\n### Risk of TB infection\\n\\nCertain living or working conditions make it easier for the disease to pass\\nfrom one person to another. These conditions increase the risk of getting a TB\\ninfection:\\n\\n  * Living with someone with active TB disease.\\n  * Living or traveling in a country where TB is common, including several countries in Latin America, Africa, Asia and the Pacific Islands.\\n  * Living or working in places where people live close together, such as prisons, nursing homes and shelters for homeless people.\\n  * Living in a community identified as being at high risk of tuberculosis.\\n  * Working in health care and treating people with a high risk of TB.\\n\\n### Risk of active TB disease\\n\\nA weakened immune system increases the risk of a TB infection becoming active\\nTB disease. Conditions or treatments that weaken the immune system include:\\n\\n  * HIV/AIDS.\\n  * Diabetes.\\n  * Severe kidney disease.\\n  * Cancers of the head, neck and blood.\\n  * Malnutrition or low body weight.\\n  * Cancer treatment, such as chemotherapy.\\n  * Drugs to prevent rejection of transplanted organs.\\n  * Long-term use of prescription steroids.\\n  * Use of unlawful injected drugs.\\n  * Misuse of alcohol.\\n  * Smoking and using other tobacco products.\\n\\n### Age and active TB disease\\n\\nThe risk of a TB infection becoming active TB disease changes with age.\\n\\n  * **Under 5 years of age.** Until children reach age 5, they have high risk of a TB infection becoming active TB disease. The risk is greater for children under age 2. Tuberculosis in this age group often leads to serious disease in the fluid surrounding the brain and spinal column, called meningitis.\\n  * **Age 15 to 25.** People in this age group have an increased risk of developing more-severe active TB disease in the lungs.\\n  * **Age 65 and older.** The immune system weakens during older age. Older adults have a greater risk of active TB disease. Also, the disease may be more difficult to treat.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n## Prevention\\n\\nIf you test positive for latent TB infection, you may need to take drugs to\\nprevent active TB disease.\\n\\n### Preventing the spread of disease\\n\\nIf you have active TB disease, you'll need to take steps to prevent other\\npeople from getting an infection. You will take drugs for four, six or nine\\nmonths. Take all of the drugs as directed during the entire time.\\n\\nDuring the first 2 to 3 weeks, you will be able to pass TB bacteria to others.\\nProtect others with these steps:\\n\\n  * **Stay home.** Don't go to work or school.\\n  * **Isolate at home.** Spend as little time as possible among members of your household. Sleep in a separate room.\\n  * **Ventilate the room.** Tuberculosis germs spread more easily in small, closed spaces. If it's not too cold outdoors, open the windows. Use a fan to blow air out. If you have more than one window, use one fan to blow air out and another to blow air in.\\n  * **Wear face masks.** Wear a mask when you have to be around other people. Ask other members of the household to wear masks to protect themselves.\\n  * **Cover your mouth.** Use a tissue to cover your mouth anytime you sneeze or cough. Put the dirty tissue in a bag, seal it and throw it away.\\n\\n### \\n---------------------\\nContent for topic 'vaccination':\\nVaccinations\\n\\nIn countries where tuberculosis is common, infants often are vaccinated with\\nthe bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine. This protects infants and toddlers\\nwho are more likely to have active TB disease in the fluid surrounding the\\nbrain and spinal cord.\\n\\nThe vaccine may not protect against disease in the lungs, which is more likely\\nin the United States.

They release tiny droplets that carry the bacteria through the air.\\nThis can happen when they're speaking, singing, laughing, coughing or\\nsneezing. A person can get an infection after inhaling the droplets.\\n\\nThe disease is more likely to spread when people spend a lot of time together\\nin an indoor space. So the disease spreads easily in places where people live\\nor work together for long periods. Also, the disease spreads more easily in\\ncrowded gatherings.\\n\\nA person with a latent TB infection cannot pass the disease to other people. A\\nperson taking drugs to treat active TB disease usually can't pass the disease\\nafter 2 to 3 weeks of treatment.\\n\\n### Drug-resistant TB\\n\\nSome forms of the TB bacteria have become drug resistant. This means that\\ndrugs that once cured the disease no longer work.\\n\\nThis happens, in part, because of naturally occurring genetic changes in\\nbacteria. A random genetic change in a bacterium might give it some quality\\nthat makes it more likely to survive the attack of an antibiotic. If it does\\nsurvive, then it can multiply.\\n\\nWhen antibiotic drugs aren't used correctly — or drugs fail to kill all the\\nbacteria for another reason — the conditions are ideal for more-resistant\\nversions of the bacteria to get established and multiply. If these bacteria\\nare passed on to other people, a new drug-resistant strain can grow over time.\\n\\nProblems that can lead to such drug-resistant strains of bacteria include the\\nfollowing:\\n\\n  * People didn't follow directions for taking the drugs or stopped taking the drugs.\\n  * They weren't prescribed the right treatment plan.\\n  * Drugs were not available.\\n  * The drugs were of poor quality.\\n  * The body didn't absorb the drugs as expected.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n## Risk factors\\n\\nAnyone can get tuberculosis, but certain factors increase the risk of getting\\nan infection. Other factors increase the risk of an infection becoming active\\nTB disease.\\n\\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends a TB test for people\\nwho have an increased risk of TB infection or active TB disease. Talk to your\\nhealth care provider if you have one or more of the following risk factors.\\n\\n### Risk of TB infection\\n\\nCertain living or working conditions make it easier for the disease to pass\\nfrom one person to another. These conditions increase the risk of getting a TB\\ninfection:\\n\\n  * Living with someone with active TB disease.\\n  * Living or traveling in a country where TB is common, including several countries in Latin America, Africa, Asia and the Pacific Islands.\\n  * Living or working in places where people live close together, such as prisons, nursing homes and shelters for homeless people.\\n  * Living in a community identified as being at high risk of tuberculosis.\\n  * Working in health care and treating people with a high risk of TB.\\n\\n### Risk of active TB disease\\n\\nA weakened immune system increases the risk of a TB infection becoming active\\nTB disease. Conditions or treatments that weaken the immune system include:\\n\\n  * HIV/AIDS.\\n  * Diabetes.\\n  * Severe kidney disease.\\n  * Cancers of the head, neck and blood.\\n  * Malnutrition or low body weight.\\n  * Cancer treatment, such as chemotherapy.\\n  * Drugs to prevent rejection of transplanted organs.\\n  * Long-term use of prescription steroids.\\n  * Use of unlawful injected drugs.\\n  * Misuse of alcohol.\\n  * Smoking and using other tobacco products.\\n\\n### Age and active TB disease\\n\\nThe risk of a TB infection becoming active TB disease changes with age.\\n\\n  * **Under 5 years of age.** Until children reach age 5, they have high risk of a TB infection becoming active TB disease. The risk is greater for children under age 2. Tuberculosis in this age group often leads to serious disease in the fluid surrounding the brain and spinal column, called meningitis.\\n  * **Age 15 to 25.** People in this age group have an increased risk of developing more-severe active TB disease in the lungs.\\n  * **Age 65 and older.** The immune system weakens during older age. Older adults have a greater risk of active TB disease. Also, the disease may be more difficult to treat.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n## Prevention\\n\\nIf you test positive for latent TB infection, you may need to take drugs to\\nprevent active TB disease.\\n\\n### Preventing the spread of disease\\n\\nIf you have active TB disease, you'll need to take steps to prevent other\\npeople from getting an infection. You will take drugs for four, six or nine\\nmonths. Take all of the drugs as directed during the entire time.\\n\\nDuring the first 2 to 3 weeks, you will be able to pass TB bacteria to others.\\nProtect others with these steps:\\n\\n  * **Stay home.** Don't go to work or school.\\n  * **Isolate at home.** Spend as little time as possible among members of your household. Sleep in a separate room.\\n  * **Ventilate the room.** Tuberculosis germs spread more easily in small, closed spaces. If it's not too cold outdoors, open the windows. Use a fan to blow air out. If you have more than one window, use one fan to blow air out and another to blow air in.\\n  * **Wear face masks.** Wear a mask when you have to be around other people. Ask other members of the household to wear masks to protect themselves.\\n  * **Cover your mouth.** Use a tissue to cover your mouth anytime you sneeze or cough. Put the dirty tissue in a bag, seal it and throw it away.\\n\\n### \\n---------------------\\nContent for topic 'vaccination':\\nVaccinations\\n\\nIn countries where tuberculosis is common, infants often are vaccinated with\\nthe bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine. This protects infants and toddlers\\nwho are more likely to have active TB disease in the fluid surrounding the\\nbrain and spinal cord.\\n\\nThe vaccine may not protect against disease in the lungs, which is more likely\\nin the United States. Dozens of new TB vaccines are in various stages of\\ndevelopment and testing.\\n\", score=0.8124196), QueryResponse(id='fe53763b-6d46-4c96-846e-61ff7c28e88f', embedding=None, metadata={'document': \"\\n\\n# Pulmonary fibrosis\\n\\nRequest an Appointment\\n\\n  * Symptoms &  \\n\\n---------------------\\nContent for topic 'when to see a doctor':\\nWhen to see a doctor\\n\\nIf you have symptoms of pulmonary fibrosis, contact your doctor or other\\nhealthcare professional as soon as possible.

Pulmonary fibrosis with no known cause is called\\nidiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.\\n\\nMany people with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis also may have gastroesophageal\\nreflux disease, also called GERD. This condition occurs when acid from the\\nstomach flows back into the esophagus. GERD may be a risk factor for\\nidiopathic pulmonary fibrosis or cause the condition to worsen faster. But\\nmore studies are needed.\\n\\n## Risk factors\\n\\nPulmonary fibrosis has been found in children and infants, but this is not\\ncommon. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is much more likely to affect middle-\\naged and older adults. Other types of pulmonary fibrosis, such as that caused\\nby connective tissue disease, can occur in younger people.\\n\\nFactors that can raise your risk of pulmonary fibrosis include:\\n\\n  * **Smoking.** If you smoke now or used to smoke, you're at a higher risk of pulmonary fibrosis than people who never smoked. People with emphysema are at higher risk, too.\\n  * **Certain types of work.** You have a higher risk of developing pulmonary fibrosis if you work in mining, farming or construction. The risk also is higher if you have continuous or repeated contact with pollutants known to damage the lungs.\\n  * **Cancer treatments.** Having radiation treatments to your chest or using certain chemotherapy medicines can raise your risk of pulmonary fibrosis.\\n  * **Genetics.** Some types of pulmonary fibrosis run in families, so genes may play a role.\\n\\n## \\n---------------------\\nContent for topic 'complications':\\nComplications\\n\\nComplications of pulmonary fibrosis may include:\\n\\n  * **High blood pressure in the lungs.** Called pulmonary hypertension, this type of high blood pressure affects the arteries in the lungs.

But\\nif the pericardium is diseased or injured, the resulting inflammation can lead\\nto excess fluid. Fluid can also build up around the heart without\\ninflammation, such as from bleeding, related to a cancer or after chest\\ntrauma.\\n\\nPericardial effusion can put pressure on the heart, affecting how the heart\\nworks. If untreated, it may lead to heart failure or death in extreme cases.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n## Symptoms\\n\\nPericardial effusion may not cause any noticeable signs and symptoms,\\nparticularly if the fluid has increased slowly.\\n\\nIf pericardial effusion signs and symptoms do occur, they might include:\\n\\n  * Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing (dyspnea)\\n  * Discomfort when breathing while lying down\\n  * Chest pain, usually behind the breastbone or on the left side of the chest\\n  * Chest fullness\\n  * Lightheadedness or feeling faint\\n  * Swelling in the abdomen or legs\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n## When to see a doctor\\n\\nCall 911 or your local emergency number if you feel chest pain that lasts more\\nthan a few minutes, if your breathing is difficult or painful, or if you have\\nan unexplained fainting spell.\\n\\nSee your health care provider if you have shortness of breath.\\n\\nRequest an appointment\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n## Causes\\n\\nPericardial effusion can result from inflammation of the pericardium\\n(pericarditis) after an illness or injury. In some settings, large effusions\\nmay be caused by certain cancers. A blockage of pericardial fluids or a\\ncollection of blood within the pericardium also can lead to this condition.\\n\\nSometimes the cause can't be determined (idiopathic pericarditis).\\n\\nCauses of pericardial effusion may include:\\n\\n  * Autoimmune disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus\\n  * Cancer of the heart or pericardium\\n  * Spread of cancer (metastasis), particularly lung cancer, breast cancer or Hodgkin's lymphoma\\n  * Radiation therapy for cancer if the heart was in the area of the radiation\\n  * Chest trauma\\n  * Inflammation of the pericardium following a heart attack or after heart surgery or a procedure where the heart's lining is injured\\n  * Underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism)\\n  * Use of certain drugs or exposure to toxins\\n  * Viral, bacterial, fungal or parasitic infections\\n  * Waste products in the blood due to kidney failure (uremia)\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n## Complications\\n\\nA potential complication of pericardial effusion is cardiac tamponade (tam-\\npon-AYD). In this condition, the excess fluid within the pericardium puts\\npressure on the heart. The strain prevents the heart chambers from filling\\ncompletely with blood.\\n\\nCardiac tamponade results in poor blood flow and a lack of oxygen to the body.\\nCardiac tamponade is life-threatening and requires emergency medical\\ntreatment.\\n\\nRequest an appointment\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nBy Mayo Clinic Staff\\n\\nNov 13, 2021\\n\\nPrint\\n\\nShow References\\n\\n  1.

But\\nif the pericardium is diseased or injured, the resulting inflammation can lead\\nto excess fluid. Fluid can also build up around the heart without\\ninflammation, such as from bleeding, related to a cancer or after chest\\ntrauma.\\n\\nPericardial effusion can put pressure on the heart, affecting how the heart\\nworks. If untreated, it may lead to heart failure or death in extreme cases.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n## Symptoms\\n\\nPericardial effusion may not cause any noticeable signs and symptoms,\\nparticularly if the fluid has increased slowly.\\n\\nIf pericardial effusion signs and symptoms do occur, they might include:\\n\\n  * Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing (dyspnea)\\n  * Discomfort when breathing while lying down\\n  * Chest pain, usually behind the breastbone or on the left side of the chest\\n  * Chest fullness\\n  * Lightheadedness or feeling faint\\n  * Swelling in the abdomen or legs\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n## When to see a doctor\\n\\nCall 911 or your local emergency number if you feel chest pain that lasts more\\nthan a few minutes, if your breathing is difficult or painful, or if you have\\nan unexplained fainting spell.\\n\\nSee your health care provider if you have shortness of breath.\\n\\nRequest an appointment\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n## Causes\\n\\nPericardial effusion can result from inflammation of the pericardium\\n(pericarditis) after an illness or injury. In some settings, large effusions\\nmay be caused by certain cancers. A blockage of pericardial fluids or a\\ncollection of blood within the pericardium also can lead to this condition.\\n\\nSometimes the cause can't be determined (idiopathic pericarditis).\\n\\nCauses of pericardial effusion may include:\\n\\n  * Autoimmune disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus\\n  * Cancer of the heart or pericardium\\n  * Spread of cancer (metastasis), particularly lung cancer, breast cancer or Hodgkin's lymphoma\\n  * Radiation therapy for cancer if the heart was in the area of the radiation\\n  * Chest trauma\\n  * Inflammation of the pericardium following a heart attack or after heart surgery or a procedure where the heart's lining is injured\\n  * Underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism)\\n  * Use of certain drugs or exposure to toxins\\n  * Viral, bacterial, fungal or parasitic infections\\n  * Waste products in the blood due to kidney failure (uremia)\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n## Complications\\n\\nA potential complication of pericardial effusion is cardiac tamponade (tam-\\npon-AYD). In this condition, the excess fluid within the pericardium puts\\npressure on the heart. The strain prevents the heart chambers from filling\\ncompletely with blood.\\n\\nCardiac tamponade results in poor blood flow and a lack of oxygen to the body.\\nCardiac tamponade is life-threatening and requires emergency medical\\ntreatment.\\n\\nRequest an appointment\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nBy Mayo Clinic Staff\\n\\nNov 13, 2021\\n\\nPrint\\n\\nShow References\\n\\n  1.

Sometimes the heart gets larger and becomes weak for unknown\\nreasons. This condition is called idiopathic cardiomyopathy.\\n\\nConditions associated with an enlarged heart include:\\n\\n  * **Heart condition present at birth (congenital heart defect).** Problems with the structure and function of the heart can cause the heart muscle to get larger and weak.\\n  * **Damage from a heart attack.** Scarring and other structural heart damage can make it harder for the heart to pump enough blood to the body. The strain can lead to heart swelling and eventual heart failure.\\n  * **Diseases of the heart muscle (cardiomyopathy).** Cardiomyopathy often makes the heart rigid or thick. It can make it harder for the heart to pump blood.\\n  * **Fluid buildup in the sac around the heart (pericardial effusion).** A collection of fluid in the sac that contains the heart can cause heart enlargement that can be seen on a chest X-ray.\\n  * **Heart valve disease.** Four valves in the heart keep blood flowing in the right direction. Disease or damage to any of the valves may interrupt blood flow and cause the heart chambers to get larger.\\n  * **High blood pressure (hypertension).** If you have high blood pressure, the heart may have to pump harder to deliver blood to the rest of the body. The strain can cause the heart muscle to grow larger and become weak.\\n  * **High blood pressure in the arteries in the lungs (pulmonary hypertension).** The heart has to work harder to move blood between the lungs and the heart. The strain may lead to thickening or enlargement of the right side of the heart.\\n  * **Low red blood cell count (anemia).** In anemia, there\\'s a lack of healthy red blood cells to carry proper levels of oxygen to the body\\'s tissues. The heart must pump more blood to make up for the lack of oxygen in the blood.\\n  * **Thyroid disorders.** Both an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism) and an overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism) can lead to heart problems, including an enlarged heart.\\n  * **Too much iron in the body (hemochromatosis).** Iron can build up in various organs, including the heart. This can cause the lower left heart chamber to swell.\\n  * **Unusual protein deposits in the heart (cardiac amyloidosis).** This rare disease causes a protein called amyloid to collect in the blood and get stuck in body organs, including the heart. Amyloid protein deposits in the heart cause an irreversible thickening of the heart wall. The heart has to work harder to fill with blood.\\n  * **Aerobic exercise.** In some athletes, the heart becomes enlarged as a response to frequent and prolonged exercise. Usually, this type of enlarged heart isn\\'t considered a disease and doesn\\'t need treatment.\\n  * **Fat around the heart.** Some people have extra fat around the heart that can appear on a chest X-ray. Unless there are other heart conditions associated, no treatment is necessary.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n## Risk factors\\n\\nThings that can increase the risk of an enlarged heart (cardiomegaly) include:\\n\\n  * **A family history of heart muscle disease (cardiomyopathy).** Some types of cardiomyopathy run in families. Tell your health care provider if a parent or sibling has a history of a thick, rigid or enlarged heart.\\n  * **High blood pressure.** This means having a blood pressure measurement higher than 140/90 millimeters of mercury.\\n  * **Heart diseases.** Any problem affecting the heart, including congenital heart defects or heart valve disease, may lead to heart enlargement. It\\'s important to follow a healthy lifestyle and have regular health checkups to manage heart disease.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n## Complications\\n\\nThe risk of complications from an enlarged heart depends on the part of the\\nheart affected and the cause. Complications of an enlarged heart can include:\\n\\n  * **Heart failure.** Heart failure may occur if the left lower heart chamber (left ventricle) becomes enlarged. In heart failure, the heart can\\'t pump the proper amount of blood throughout the body.\\n  * **Blood clots.** Blood clots may form in the lining of the heart. A blood clot that forms on the right side of the heart can travel to the lungs (pulmonary embolism). If a clot blocks blood flow, you could have a heart attack or stroke.\\n  * **Leaky heart valve (regurgitation).** Heart enlargement may prevent the mitral and tricuspid heart valves from closing, causing blood to leak backward. The interrupted blood flow creates a sound called a heart murmur. Although not necessarily harmful, heart murmurs should be monitored by a health care provider.\\n  * **Cardiac arrest and sudden death.** An enlarged heart may cause the heart to beat too fast or too slow. The irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia) may lead to fainting, cardiac arrest or sudden death.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n## Prevention\\n\\nTell your health care provider if anyone in your family has or had\\ncardiomyopathy or other health conditions that caused an enlarged heart. When\\ndiagnosed early, proper treatment of the underlying condition may prevent the\\nenlarged heart from getting worse.\\n\\nFollowing a heart-healthy lifestyle can help prevent or manage some conditions\\nthat can lead to an enlarged heart. Take these steps to help prevent an\\nenlarged heart:\\n\\n  * Monitor and manage high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes.\\n  * Take any prescribed medications as directed.\\n  * Eat a nutritious, balanced diet.\\n  * Get regular exercise.\\n  * Avoid or limit alcohol.\\n  * Don\\'t smoke.\\n  * Don\\'t use illegal drugs.\\n\\n\\n  * CT scan\\n\\nShow more associated procedures\\n\\n  * Echocardiogram\\n\\n  * Electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG)\\n\\n  * Heart transplant\\n\\n  * Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs)\\n\\n  * MRI\\n\\n  * Pacemaker\\n\\n  * Stress test\\n\\n  * Ventricular assist device\\n\\nCON-XXXXXXXX\\n\\nSkip Advertisement\\n\\n## Advertisement\\n\\nMayo Clinic does not endorse companies or products.

Lung damage can be caused by many types of underlying diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis, lung cancer or pneumonia. Cystic lung diseases, such as lymphangioleiomyomatosis and Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome, cause round, thin-walled air sacs in the lung tissue that can rupture, resulting in pneumothorax.\\n  * **Ruptured air blisters.** Small air blisters (blebs) can develop on the top of the lungs. These air blisters sometimes burst -- allowing air to leak into the space that surrounds the lungs.\\n  * **Mechanical ventilation.** A severe type of pneumothorax can occur in people who need mechanical assistance to breathe.

Data has shown\\nthat the COVID-19 virus spreads mainly from person to person among those in\\nclose contact. The virus spreads by respiratory droplets released when someone\\nwith the virus coughs, sneezes, breathes, sings or talks. These droplets can\\nbe inhaled or land in the mouth, nose or eyes of a person nearby.\\n\\nSometimes the COVID-19 virus can spread when a person is exposed to very small\\ndroplets or aerosols that stay in the air for several minutes or hours --\\ncalled airborne transmission.\\n\\nThe virus also can spread if you touch a surface with the virus on it and then\\ntouch your mouth, nose or eyes. But the risk is low.\\n\\nThe COVID-19 virus can spread from someone who is infected but has no\\nsymptoms. This is called asymptomatic transmission. The COVID-19 virus also\\ncan spread from someone who is infected but hasn't developed symptoms yet.\\nThis is called presymptomatic transmission.\\n\\nIt's possible to get COVID-19 more than once.\\n\\n## \\n---------------------\\nContent for topic 'causes':\\ncauses\\n\\n  * Diagnosis &  \\ntreatment\\n\\n  * Doctors &  \\ndepartments\\n\\nPrint\\n\\n## Overview\\n\\nCoronavirus Enlarge image\\n\\nClose\\n\\n### Coronavirus\\n\\n### Coronavirus\\n\\nCoronaviruses are a family of viruses.

This time after exposure and before having symptoms is called the\\nincubation period. You can still spread COVID-19 before you have symptoms.\\nThis is called presymptomatic transmission. Common symptoms can include:\\n\\n  * Fever.\\n  * Cough.\\n  * Tiredness.\\n\\nEarly symptoms of COVID-19 may include a loss of taste or smell.\\n\\nOther symptoms may include:\\n\\n  * Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing.\\n  * Muscle aches.\\n  * Chills.\\n  * Sore throat.\\n  * Runny nose.\\n  * Headache.\\n  * Chest pain.\\n  * Pink eye (conjunctivitis).\\n  * Nausea.\\n  * Vomiting.\\n  * Diarrhea.\\n  * Rash.\\n\\nThis list isn't complete.

Some people may have no symptoms at all,\\nbut can still spread it. This is called asymptomatic transmission.\\n\\nSome people may experience worsened symptoms, such as worsened shortness of\\nbreath and pneumonia, about a week after symptoms start. Some people\\nexperience COVID-19 symptoms for more than four weeks after they're diagnosed.\\nThese health issues are sometimes called post-COVID-19 conditions.\\n\\nSome children experience multisystem inflammatory syndrome, a syndrome that\\ncan affect some organs and tissues, several weeks after having COVID-19.\\nRarely, some adults experience the syndrome too.\\n\\n### \\n---------------------\\nContent for topic 'risk factors':\\nRisk factors\\n\\nRisk factors for COVID-19 appear to include:\\n\\n  * Close contact with someone who has COVID-19, especially someone with symptoms.\\n  * Being coughed or sneezed on by an infected person.\\n  * Being near an infected person when in an indoor space with poor airflow.\\n\\n### Risk factors for serious COVID-19 illness\\n\\nSome people are at a higher risk of serious COVID-19 illness than others. This\\nincludes people who are older, and the risk increases with age.\\n\\nPeople with existing medical conditions also may have a higher risk of serious\\nillness. This includes people who have:\\n\\n  * Sickle cell disease or thalassemia.\\n  * Serious heart diseases, such as heart failure, coronary artery disease or cardiomyopathy, and possibly high blood pressure.\\n  * Chronic kidney, liver or lung diseases.\\n\\nPeople with dementia or Alzheimer's are also at higher risk, as are people\\nwith brain and nervous system conditions such as stroke.

Data has shown\\nthat the COVID-19 virus spreads mainly from person to person among those in\\nclose contact. The virus spreads by respiratory droplets released when someone\\nwith the virus coughs, sneezes, breathes, sings or talks. These droplets can\\nbe inhaled or land in the mouth, nose or eyes of a person nearby.\\n\\nSometimes the COVID-19 virus can spread when a person is exposed to very small\\ndroplets or aerosols that stay in the air for several minutes or hours --\\ncalled airborne transmission.\\n\\nThe virus also can spread if you touch a surface with the virus on it and then\\ntouch your mouth, nose or eyes. But the risk is low.\\n\\nThe COVID-19 virus can spread from someone who is infected but has no\\nsymptoms. This is called asymptomatic transmission. The COVID-19 virus also\\ncan spread from someone who is infected but hasn't developed symptoms yet.\\nThis is called presymptomatic transmission.\\n\\nIt's possible to get COVID-19 more than once.\\n\\n## \\n---------------------\\nContent for topic 'causes':\\ncauses\\n\\n  * Diagnosis &  \\ntreatment\\n\\n  * Doctors &  \\ndepartments\\n\\nPrint\\n\\n## Overview\\n\\nCoronavirus Enlarge image\\n\\nClose\\n\\n### Coronavirus\\n\\n### Coronavirus\\n\\nCoronaviruses are a family of viruses.
